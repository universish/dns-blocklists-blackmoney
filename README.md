# DNS Blocklists - to protect from black money and pirated content etc.
I have merged the lists of domains with black money and black market purposes and illegal and black money advertisements and inhumane and disorderly and propaganda and pirated content. I did not create the lists, I did not check their content, I just merged and published them. You can apply to contribute to the list.  
(for now I could only add piracy sites).
